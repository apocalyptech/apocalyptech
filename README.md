Howdy, I'm apocalyptech.  Feel free to check out my main website,
[apocalyptech.com](https://apocalyptech.com), and my [list of repos here
at Github](https://github.com/apocalyptech).

I've got a variety of stuff, though a lot of it's videogame related,
most of it's in Python, and nearly all of it is of questionable usefulness,
at best.

Cheers!
